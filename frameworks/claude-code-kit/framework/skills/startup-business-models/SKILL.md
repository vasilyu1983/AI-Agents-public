## Unit Economics Framework

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| **LTV** | ARPU × Gross Margin × (1 / Churn Rate) | 3x+ CAC | Lifetime customer value |
| **CAC** | Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers | LTV/3 | Customer acquisition cost |
| **LTV:CAC** | LTV / CAC | >3:1 | Efficiency ratio |
| **Payback** | CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin) | <12 months | Months to recover CAC |
| **Gross Margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | >70% (SaaS) | Profitability per unit |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | (Starting MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting MRR | >100% | Growth from existing |
| **Churn Rate** | Lost Customers / Total Customers | <5% annual | Customer retention |

### LTV Calculation Methods

**Simple LTV**:
```
LTV = ARPU × Average Customer Lifetime

Where: Average Customer Lifetime = 1 / Monthly Churn Rate
```

**Margin-Adjusted LTV**:
```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × (1 / Churn Rate)
```

**Cohort-Based LTV** (Most Accurate):
```
LTV = Σ (Revenue per Cohort Month × Retention Rate at Month)
```

### CAC Calculation

**Fully-Loaded CAC**:
```
CAC = (Sales Salaries + Marketing Spend + Sales Tools +
       Marketing Tools + Content + Events + Agency Fees) /
       New Customers Acquired
```

**By Channel**:
| Channel | Spend | Customers | CAC |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Paid Search | $X | N | $X |
| Content/SEO | $X | N | $X |
| Sales Outbound | $X | N | $X |
| Referral | $X | N | $X |
| **Blended** | $X | N | $X |

### Unit Economics by Stage

| Stage | LTV:CAC | Payback | Focus |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| Pre-PMF | N/A | N/A | Finding product-market fit |
| Early | 1-2x | 18-24 mo | Proving unit economics work |
| Growth | 3-4x | 12-18 mo | Scaling efficiently |
| Scale | 4-5x+ | <12 mo | Optimizing profitability |

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Approaches

| Approach | Method | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Value-Based** | Price = % of customer value | B2B, clear ROI |
| **Competition-Based** | Price relative to alternatives | Commoditized markets |
| **Cost-Plus** | Cost + target margin | Low differentiation |
| **Willingness-to-Pay** | Research-based WTP | New markets, no reference |

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

```
1. QUANTIFY CUSTOMER VALUE
   └─► What's the $ impact of your solution?

2. IDENTIFY VALUE DRIVERS
   └─► Time saved? Revenue gained? Cost reduced?

3. SET PRICE AS % OF VALUE
   └─► Typically 10-30% of quantified value

4. VALIDATE WITH CUSTOMERS
   └─► Willingness-to-pay research
```

### Pricing Tiers Design

| Element | Free | Starter | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|---------|-----|------------|
| **Target** | Individuals | Small teams | Growth teams | Large orgs |
| **Price** | $0 | $X/mo | $X/mo | Custom |
| **Limits** | X users, Y usage | X users, Y usage | X users, Y usage | Unlimited |
| **Features** | Core only | Core + Basic | Core + Advanced | All + Custom |
| **Support** | Community | Email | Priority | Dedicated |
| **Billing** | — | Monthly/Annual | Monthly/Annual | Annual |

### Pricing Levers

| Lever | Options | Considerations |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Metric** | Per seat, per usage, flat | Align with value delivery |
| **Frequency** | Monthly, annual, one-time | Cash flow vs. commitment |
| **Discounts** | Volume, annual, startup | Incentive alignment |
| **Bundling** | All-in-one vs. à la carte | Simplicity vs. customization |
| **Anchoring** | Show expensive option first | Psychological pricing |

### Willingness-to-Pay Research

**Van Westendorp Method** (Price Sensitivity Meter):

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "At what price is this too expensive?" | Upper bound |
| "At what price is this expensive but acceptable?" | Premium threshold |
| "At what price is this a bargain?" | Value perception |
| "At what price is this too cheap (suspicious)?" | Lower bound |

**Gabor-Granger Method**:
```
1. Show product at price point A
2. "Would you buy at this price?" Y/N
3. If Yes → Show higher price
4. If No → Show lower price
5. Repeat to find demand curve
```

## SaaS Metrics Deep Dive

### MRR Components

| Component | Definition | Formula |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **New MRR** | From new customers | Sum(New Customer MRR) |
| **Expansion MRR** | Upgrades + add-ons | Sum(Upsell + Cross-sell) |
| **Contraction MRR** | Downgrades | Sum(Downgrade MRR) |
| **Churn MRR** | Lost customers | Sum(Churned Customer MRR) |
| **Net New MRR** | Monthly change | New + Expansion - Contraction - Churn |

### Cohort Analysis Template

| Cohort | M0 | M1 | M2 | M3 | M6 | M12 |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Jan 2024 | 100% | 95% | 90% | 88% | 82% | 75% |
| Feb 2024 | 100% | 93% | 88% | 85% | 80% | — |
| Mar 2024 | 100% | 94% | 89% | 86% | — | — |

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR × 100%

Benchmarks:
- <100%: Leaky bucket (fix churn first)
- 100-110%: Healthy
- 110-120%: Strong
- >120%: Exceptional (enterprise, land-and-expand)
```

## Marketplace Economics

### Key Marketplace Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **GMV** | Total transaction value | Growth rate |
| **Take Rate** | Revenue / GMV | 5-30% |
| **Liquidity** | Successful transactions / Attempts | >80% |
| **CAC Supply** | Cost to acquire seller/provider | — |
| **CAC Demand** | Cost to acquire buyer/consumer | — |
| **ARPU** | Revenue per active user | — |

### Take Rate by Category

| Category | Typical Take Rate | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Rideshare | 20-30% | High service component |
| E-commerce | 10-15% | Logistics adds value |
| Services | 15-25% | Trust/vetting value |
| B2B | 5-15% | Lower, higher volume |
| Digital goods | 15-30% | No physical logistics |

### Marketplace Unit Economics

```
Buyer Side:
LTV = Transactions/Year × AOV × Take Rate × Retention Years

Seller Side:
LTV = GMV/Year × Take Rate × Retention Years

Combined:
Platform LTV = Buyer LTV + Seller LTV - Cross-Subsidization
```
