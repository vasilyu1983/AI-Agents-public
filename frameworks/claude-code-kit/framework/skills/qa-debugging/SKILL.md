# Debugging & Troubleshooting — Quick Reference

This skill provides execution-ready debugging strategies, troubleshooting workflows, and root cause analysis techniques. Claude should apply these patterns when users encounter bugs, errors, performance issues, or production incidents.

**Modern Best Practices (2025)**: Structured logging (Pino/Winston), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), error tracking (Sentry/Rollbar), observability-first debugging, time-travel debugging, AI-assisted error analysis, and proactive monitoring.

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Tool/Technique | Command/Approach | When to Use |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Application crashes | Stack trace analysis | Check error logs, identify first line in your code | Unhandled exceptions |
| Slow performance | Profiling (CPU/memory) | `node --prof`, Chrome DevTools, cProfile | High CPU, latency issues |
| Memory leak | Heap snapshots | `node --inspect`, compare snapshots over time | Memory usage grows |
| Database slow | Query profiling | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, slow query log | Slow queries, high DB CPU |
| Production-only bug | Log analysis + feature flags | `grep "ERROR"`, enable verbose logging for user | Can't reproduce locally |
| Distributed system issue | Distributed tracing | OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, trace request ID | Microservices, async workflows |
| Intermittent failures | Logging + monitoring | Add detailed logs, monitor metrics | Race conditions, timeouts |
| Network timeout | Network debugging | `curl`, Postman, check firewall/DNS | External API failures |

## Decision Tree: Debugging Strategy

```text
Issue type: [Problem Scenario]
    ├─ Application Behavior?
    │   ├─ Crashes immediately? → Check stack trace, error logs
    │   ├─ Slow/hanging? → CPU/memory profiling
    │   ├─ Intermittent failures? → Add logging, reproduce consistently
    │   └─ Unexpected output? → Binary search (add logs to narrow down)
    │
    ├─ Performance Issues?
    │   ├─ High CPU? → CPU profiler to find hot functions
    │   ├─ Memory leak? → Heap snapshots, track over time
    │   ├─ Slow database? → EXPLAIN ANALYZE, check indexes
    │   ├─ Network latency? → Trace external API calls
    │   └─ Frontend slow? → Lighthouse, Web Vitals profiling
    │
    ├─ Production-Only?
    │   ├─ Can't reproduce? → Analyze logs for patterns
    │   ├─ Environment difference? → Compare configs, data volume
    │   ├─ Need safe debugging? → Feature flags for verbose logging
    │   └─ Recent deployment? → Git bisect to find regression
    │
    ├─ Distributed Systems?
    │   ├─ Multiple services involved? → Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
    │   ├─ Request lost? → Search logs by request ID
    │   ├─ Service dependency? → Check health checks, circuit breakers
    │   └─ Async workflow? → Trace message queue, event logs
    │
    └─ Error Type?
        ├─ TypeError/NullPointer? → Check object existence, defensive coding
        ├─ Network timeout? → Check external service health, retry logic
        ├─ Database error? → Check connection pool, query syntax
        └─ Unknown error? → Systematic debugging workflow (observe, hypothesize, test)
```

# Quick Decision Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | First Action |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Application crashes | Unhandled exception | Check error logs and stack trace |
| Slow performance | Database/network/CPU bottleneck | Profile with performance tools |
| Memory usage grows | Memory leak | Take heap snapshots over time |
| Intermittent failures | Race condition, network timeout | Add detailed logging around failure |
| Production-only bug | Environment difference, data volume | Compare prod vs dev config/data |
| High CPU usage | Infinite loop, inefficient algorithm | CPU profiler to find hot functions |
| Database slow | Missing index, N+1 queries | Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on slow queries |

# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Random changes** - Making changes without hypothesis
- **Inadequate logging** - Can't debug what you can't see
- **Debugging in production** - Always reproduce locally when possible
- **Ignoring stack traces** - Stack trace tells you exactly where error occurred
- **Not writing tests** - Fix today, break tomorrow
- **Symptom fixing** - Treating symptoms instead of root cause
- **No monitoring** - Flying blind in production
- **Skipping postmortems** - Not learning from incidents
