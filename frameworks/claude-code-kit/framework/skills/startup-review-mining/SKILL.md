  THE GOLD MINE: Systematic extraction of pain points, feature gaps, switching triggers,
  and opportunities from ALL review sources (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, App Store, Play Store,
  Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter/X, ProductHunt, GitHub Issues, support forums). Goes beyond
  UI/UX to cover pricing friction, support failures, integration nightmares, and value gaps.

# Review Mining Skill - The Gold Mine

This skill extracts **real customer pain** from reviews and testimonials - unfiltered, authentic, and actionable. Reviews are where customers complain about problems they'll pay to solve.

**Key Distinction from `software-ux-research`**:
- `software-ux-research` = UI/UX pain points only
- `startup-review-mining` (this skill) = ALL pain dimensions (pricing, support, integration, performance, onboarding, value gaps)

---

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when users ask for:

- Pain point extraction from reviews (any source)
- Competitive weakness analysis
- Feature gap identification
- Switching trigger analysis (why customers leave competitors)
- Market opportunity discovery through customer complaints
- Review sentiment analysis across platforms
- B2B software evaluation (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
- B2C app analysis (App Store, Play Store)
- Community sentiment (Reddit, HN, Twitter/X)
- Support pain patterns (forums, tickets, Stack Overflow)

## The 7 Pain Dimensions

Reviews reveal pain across **7 dimensions** - not just UI/UX:

| Dimension | What to Look For | Example Signals |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **1. UI/UX Pain** | Usability, navigation, design | "confusing interface", "hard to find", "ugly design" |
| **2. Pricing Pain** | Cost, billing, contracts | "too expensive", "hidden fees", "locked in contract" |
| **3. Support Pain** | Response time, resolution quality | "slow support", "unhelpful", "no documentation" |
| **4. Integration Pain** | API complexity, data migration | "can't connect to X", "migration nightmare", "no API" |
| **5. Performance Pain** | Speed, reliability, uptime | "slow", "crashes", "downtime", "buggy" |
| **6. Onboarding Pain** | Setup complexity, time-to-value | "took weeks to set up", "steep learning curve" |
| **7. Value Pain** | Feature gaps, unmet jobs | "missing X feature", "can't do Y", "not what I needed" |

## Operational Workflow

### Standard Mining Flow

```text
1. SCOPE (Define Target)
   +-- Which product/market to analyze?
   +-- Which competitors to include?
   +-- Time range (last 6-12 months recommended)

2. EXTRACT (Gather Data)
   +-- B2B: G2 → Capterra → TrustRadius
   +-- B2C: App Store → Play Store
   +-- Tech: GitHub → HN → Stack Overflow
   +-- Social: Twitter/X → Reddit → LinkedIn

3. CATEGORIZE (7 Dimensions)
   +-- UI/UX Pain
   +-- Pricing Pain
   +-- Support Pain
   +-- Integration Pain
   +-- Performance Pain
   +-- Onboarding Pain
   +-- Value Pain

4. SCORE (Prioritize)
   +-- Frequency (how often mentioned)
   +-- Severity (how painful)
   +-- Addressability (can we solve it?)

5. MAP (Convert to Opportunities)
   +-- Quick Wins (<2 weeks)
   +-- Medium Bets (2-8 weeks)
   +-- Big Differentiation (8+ weeks)

6. OUTPUT (Deliverable)
   +-- Review Mining Report
   +-- Competitor Weakness Matrix
   +-- Opportunity Backlog
```

### Integration with Validation Pipeline

USER ASKS                              SKILL FLOW
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Find opportunities in X market"  → startup-review-mining → Pain Report
                                         ↓
"What's trending?"               → startup-trend-prediction → Timing Analysis
                                         ↓
"Should we build this?"          → startup-idea-validation → GO/NO-GO Score
                                         ↓
"What skills do we need?"        → startup-mega-router → Implementation Path

## Usage Notes

**For Claude**: When user asks to "find pain points" or "analyze reviews":
1. Ask which market/product/competitors to analyze
2. Use source-by-source-extraction.md for platform-specific queries
3. Categorize findings into 7 pain dimensions
4. Score by frequency × severity × addressability
5. Output using review-mining-report.md template

**For Claude**: When user asks to "find opportunities":
1. First extract pain points (above workflow)
2. Use review-to-opportunity-mapping.md to convert
3. Categorize into Quick Wins / Medium Bets / Big Differentiation
4. Feed to startup-idea-validation for scoring

**Output Formats**:
- Pain points: 7-dimension matrix with severity scores
- Competitor analysis: Weakness comparison with quote evidence
- Opportunities: Prioritized backlog with effort/impact estimates
- Switching triggers: Why customers leave (ranked by frequency)

**Key Principle**: Reviews are the voice of the customer. Mine them systematically.
