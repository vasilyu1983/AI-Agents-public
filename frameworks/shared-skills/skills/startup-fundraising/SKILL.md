# Startup Fundraising

Systematic framework for raising capital from pre-seed through growth stages.

## Quick Start (Inputs)

Collect these inputs first (ask concise follow-ups if missing):

- Company basics: product, ICP, geo, stage
- Traction: revenue (MRR/ARR), growth, retention/NRR, pipeline
- Financials: runway, burn, gross margin, CAC/payback (if applicable)
- Raise: target amount, instrument (SAFE/note/equity), timeline, use of funds
- Constraints: legal counsel availability, current cap table + SAFEs/notes + option pool

## Default Workflow

Use this sequence unless the user request is narrowly scoped:

1. Decide raise vs bootstrap (objectives, timing, capital intensity).
2. Size the round (18-24 months runway + milestone plan + buffer).
3. Prepare materials (deck, model, data room, narrative, metrics definitions).
4. Build investor list (stage/sector/check size/partner fit) and outreach cadence.
5. Manage diligence (data room hygiene, references, compliance, QA on metrics).
6. Negotiate/close (term sheet priorities, cap table + option pool modeling).
7. Post-close ops (cap table updates, 409A, governance, investor updates).

- Cap table hygiene: `references/cap-table-management.md`
- Post-investment ops: `references/post-investment-operations.md`

## Modern Best Practices (Jan 2026)

- **Burn multiple matters**: Investors often screen efficiency via Net Burn / Net New ARR.
- **Post-money SAFEs are common**: Many pre-seed deals use post-money SAFEs (vs notes, pre-money SAFEs).
- **Data room = product**: Clean structure, version control, index document, 409A current.
- **8 due diligence areas**: Beyond the deck - financial hygiene, unit economics, brand consistency, founder-market fit, digital reputation, customer validation, technical scalability, cap table hygiene.
- **Milestone-based raises**: Map every round to specific milestones and runway (best/base/worst).

## Fundraising Stage Overview

| Stage | Typical Raise | Valuation | Milestones to Raise |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Pre-Seed** | $250K-$1M | $2-5M | Idea, team, early prototype |
| **Seed** | $1-4M | $5-15M | MVP, early customers, PMF signals |
| **Series A** | $5-15M | $20-60M | PMF, $1-2M ARR, repeatable sales |
| **Series B** | $15-50M | $60-200M | Proven GTM, $5-15M ARR, unit economics |
| **Series C+** | $50M+ | $200M+ | Scale, expansion, path to profitability |

### What Investors Look For by Stage

| Stage | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Pre-Seed | Team, market, vision | Early traction |
| Seed | Team, PMF signals, market | Early metrics |
| Series A | PMF proof, GTM, metrics | Team, market size |
| Series B | Growth efficiency, unit economics | Market expansion |
| Series C+ | Path to profitability, scale | Market leadership |

## Should You Raise?

### Raise vs Bootstrap Decision Matrix

| Factor | Raise If | Bootstrap If |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Capital intensity** | High upfront investment needed | Low capital needs |
| **Market timing** | Land grab opportunity | Steady market |
| **Competition** | Well-funded competitors | Fragmented market |
| **Network value** | Investors add strategic value | Execution-focused |
| **Exit timeline** | <7 year exit path | Long-term hold |
| **Growth rate** | 3x+ YoY possible | Steady growth fine |

### Funding Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Equity** | Sell ownership | High-growth, VC-backable |
| **Post-money SAFE** | Equity at fixed cap, post-investment | Common at pre-seed |
| **Convertible Note** | Debt that converts to equity | Bridge rounds |
| **Debt (Venture)** | Loan with warrants | Post-revenue, bridge |
| **Revenue-Based** | % of revenue | Predictable revenue |
| **Grants** | Non-dilutive | R&D, specific industries |

### SAFE vs Convertible Note (2026)

| Feature | Post-money SAFE | Convertible Note |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Pre-seed usage** | Common | Less common |
| **Interest** | None | 2-8% annually |
| **Maturity date** | None | 12-24 months typical |
| **Complexity** | Simple (1-5 pages) | More complex (10+ pages) |

**Why post-money SAFEs are common**: Cleaner cap table modeling, predictable dilution, no debt features, and often faster to close than notes.

## Round Sizing

```text
Round Size = Monthly Burn x Runway Months + Buffer

Where:
- Runway: 18-24 months typical
- Buffer: 20-30% for unknowns
```

### Milestone-Based Sizing

| Current Stage | Raise Enough To... |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Pre-Seed | Reach Seed milestones (MVP, early customers) |
| Seed | Reach Series A milestones (PMF, $1-2M ARR) |
| Series A | Reach Series B milestones ($5-10M ARR) |
| Series B | Reach profitability or Series C ($20M+ ARR) |

### Dilution Considerations

| Round | Typical Dilution | Running Total |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Pre-Seed | 10-15% | 10-15% |
| Seed | 15-25% | 25-40% |
| Series A | 15-25% | 40-55% |
| Series B | 10-20% | 50-65% |
| Series C | 10-15% | 55-70% |

**Rule of thumb**: Keep 15-20% for option pool, founders retain >10% at exit.

## Valuation Framework

### Valuation Methods by Stage

| Stage | Method | Formula |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Pre-Seed | Comp-based | Market x stage adjustment |
| Seed | Forward multiple | Projected ARR x 10-20x |
| Series A | ARR multiple | ARR x 15-50x |
| Series B+ | ARR multiple | ARR x 10-30x |

### ARR Multiple Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Growth Rate | Multiple Range |
|-------------|----------------|
| <50% YoY | 5-10x |
| 50-100% YoY | 10-20x |
| 100-200% YoY | 20-40x |
| >200% YoY | 40-100x |

### Burn Multiple (2026 Key Metric)

The **Burn Multiple** is a common investor screening metric for efficiency.

**Formula**: `Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR`

| Burn Multiple | Interpretation | Investor View |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| <1.0x | Highly efficient | Strong signal, rare |
| 1.0-1.5x | Efficient growth | Attractive |
| 1.5-2.0x | Moderate efficiency | Acceptable with justification |
| 2.0-3.0x | Inefficient | Yellow flag |
| >3.0x | Burning cash | Red flag, likely pass |

## Investor Targeting

### Investor Types

| Type | Check Size | Stage Focus | Value-Add |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Angels** | $25K-250K | Pre-Seed, Seed | Advice, intros |
| **Syndicates** | $100K-1M | Seed | Access to angels |
| **Micro VC** | $500K-2M | Pre-Seed, Seed | Hands-on help |
| **Seed VC** | $1-5M | Seed, Series A | Portfolio support |
| **Multi-Stage VC** | $5M+ | Series A+ | Resources, brand |
| **Corporate VC** | $2-20M | Series A+ | Strategic partnership |
| **Growth Equity** | $20M+ | Series B+ | Scale expertise |

## Do / Avoid (Jan 2026)

### Do

- **Track burn multiple**: Net Burn / Net New ARR is a common investor screening metric.
- **Use post-money SAFEs when appropriate**: Common at pre-seed and simplify cap table modeling.
- **Get 409A before options**: Required for compliance, red flag if outdated.
- **Build data room early**: Start 3-4 months before fundraising, use version control.
- **Headline every slide**: Say the takeaway ("We reduce fraud 90%"), not labels ("Product Overview").

### Avoid

- **Vanity metrics without unit economics**: GMV/signups mean nothing if you're burning $3 to make $1.
- **Outdated 409A valuation**: Creates tax liability and diligence red flags.
- **Missing IP assignments**: Every contractor, intern, employee must have signed.
- Inflated TAM without bottom-up assumptions.
- Inconsistent metrics across deck, model, and data room.

## What Good Looks Like

- Narrative: one consistent story across deck, memo, and demo.
- Metrics: every KPI has a definition (formula + timeframe + source) and matches across artifacts.
- Data room: diligence-ready folder with cohorts, pipeline, contracts/terms, and key policies.
- Milestones: the raise maps to a milestone plan and runway model (best/base/worst case).
- Process: a tracked pipeline with weekly cadence (outreach, meetings, follow-ups, learnings).
