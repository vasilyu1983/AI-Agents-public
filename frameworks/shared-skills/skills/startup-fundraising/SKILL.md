# Startup Fundraising

Systematic framework for raising capital from pre-seed through growth stages.

**Modern Best Practices (Dec 2025)**:
- Fundraising readiness is milestone-based; keep metrics definitions consistent and source-backed.
- Treat the data room as a product: clean structure, owners, and “one source of truth”.
- Prefer believable narratives over inflated TAM; be explicit about assumptions and constraints.
- Optional: AI / Automation can help with formatting and drafts; never fabricate metrics.

## Should You Raise?

### Raise vs Bootstrap Decision Matrix

| Factor | Raise If | Bootstrap If |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Capital intensity** | High upfront investment needed | Low capital needs |
| **Market timing** | Land grab opportunity | Steady market |
| **Competition** | Well-funded competitors | Fragmented market |
| **Network value** | Investors add strategic value | Execution-focused |
| **Exit timeline** | <7 year exit path | Long-term hold |
| **Growth rate** | 3x+ YoY possible | Steady growth fine |

### Funding Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Equity** | Sell ownership | High-growth, VC-backable |
| **SAFE/Convertible** | Convert later | Pre-priced rounds |
| **Debt (Venture)** | Loan with warrants | Post-revenue, bridge |
| **Revenue-Based** | % of revenue | Predictable revenue |
| **Grants** | Non-dilutive | R&D, specific industries |
| **Bootstrap** | Customer revenue | Profitable path possible |

---

## Round Sizing

### How Much to Raise

```
Round Size = Monthly Burn × Runway Months + Buffer

Where:
- Runway: 18-24 months typical
- Buffer: 20-30% for unknowns
```

**Example**:
```
Monthly burn: $100K
Target runway: 24 months
Buffer: 20%

Round = $100K × 24 × 1.2 = $2.88M → Raise $3M
```

### Milestone-Based Sizing

| Current Stage | Raise Enough To... |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Pre-Seed | Reach Seed milestones (MVP, early customers) |
| Seed | Reach Series A milestones (PMF, $1-2M ARR) |
| Series A | Reach Series B milestones ($5-10M ARR) |
| Series B | Reach profitability or Series C ($20M+ ARR) |

### Dilution Considerations

| Round | Typical Dilution | Running Total |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Pre-Seed | 10-15% | 10-15% |
| Seed | 15-25% | 25-40% |
| Series A | 15-25% | 40-55% |
| Series B | 10-20% | 50-65% |
| Series C | 10-15% | 55-70% |

**Rule of thumb**: Keep 15-20% for option pool, founders retain >10% at exit.

## Do / Avoid (Dec 2025)

### Do

- Keep a metrics glossary with formulas and source links.
- Prepare cohorts and retention views early (avoid “we’ll pull it later”).
- Align the raise to milestones and a realistic runway plan.

### Avoid

- Inflated TAM without bottom-up assumptions.
- Inconsistent metrics across deck, model, and data room.
- Hiding churn or cohort issues (diligence will surface it).

## What Good Looks Like

- Narrative: one consistent story across deck, memo, and demo (problem → why now → wedge → proof).
- Metrics: every KPI has a definition (formula + timeframe + source) and matches across artifacts.
- Data room: diligence-ready folder with cohorts, pipeline, contracts/terms, and key policies.
- Milestones: the raise maps to a milestone plan and runway model (best/base/worst case).
- Process: a tracked pipeline with weekly cadence (outreach, meetings, follow-ups, learnings).

## Optional: AI / Automation

Use only when explicitly requested and policy-compliant.

- Draft deck narratives and Q&A; humans verify every number and claim.
- Format and restructure documents; do not invent customers, revenue, or pipeline.
