# SEARCH VISIBILITY & MODERN DISCOVERY — OPERATIONAL SKILL

This skill contains **actionable, production-ready systems** for content discoverability across **traditional search** and **modern SERP surfaces**. Assistant/answer-engine visibility is covered only in clearly labeled optional sections.

**Structure**: Core search visibility fundamentals first. AI-specific optimization in clearly labeled "Optional: AI / Automation" sections.

---

## Core: Search Intent Modeling

Every piece of content must map to user intent. Misaligned intent = wasted effort.

| Intent Type | User Goal | Content Format | Conversion Likelihood |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Informational** | Learn/understand | Guides, tutorials, explainers | Low (nurture) |
| **Navigational** | Find specific brand/page | Brand pages, product docs | Medium (existing interest) |
| **Commercial** | Research before buying | Comparisons, reviews, vs-pages | High |
| **Transactional** | Buy/sign up now | Pricing, checkout, demo pages | Highest |

### Do
- Map content inventory to intent types
- Prioritize commercial + transactional for revenue impact
- Use informational content for top-of-funnel brand building
- Match page structure to intent (transactional = short; informational = comprehensive)

### Avoid
- Publishing "informational" content expecting direct conversions
- Mixing multiple intents on one page
- Ignoring navigational intent (your brand searches matter)

## Modern Best Practices (January 2026)

**Sources**: [Seer Interactive GEO Guide](https://www.seerinteractive.com/insights/generative-engine-optimization), [Search Engine Land AI SEO](https://searchengineland.com/), [Ahrefs AI Overviews Study](https://ahrefs.com/blog/)

### The GEO Reality (Generative Engine Optimization)

| Metric | January 2026 Value | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **AI Overviews presence** | 15-16% of all queries | Growing steadily |
| **CTR drop from AI Overviews** | 61% average | Significant traffic loss |
| **AI Overview citations from top 10** | 76% | Traditional SEO still matters |
| **Zero-click searches** | 65%+ of all searches | Visibility ≠ clicks |
| **AI Overview conversion rate** | 14.2% (vs 2.8% organic) | 5x quality premium |

### What Changed: Traditional SEO vs GEO

| Factor | Traditional SEO | GEO (2026) |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Primary goal** | Rank in blue links | Get cited in AI responses |
| **Content format** | Long-form, comprehensive | Concise, quotable statements |
| **Authority signals** | Backlinks, domain age | Citations, original data, E-E-A-T |
| **Optimization target** | Keywords | Questions + entities |
| **Success metric** | Rankings, clicks | Citations, brand mentions |

### AI Overviews Optimization Checklist

✅ **Structure content for citation extraction:**
- First paragraph: Direct, quotable answer (40-60 words optimal for AI extraction)
- AI Overview responses average 157 words; 99% stay under 328 words
- Use "According to..." or "Research shows..." patterns
- Include specific numbers, percentages, dates
- Attribute claims to sources

✅ **Question-answer architecture:**
```markdown
## How long does [X] take?
[Direct answer in first sentence]. [Supporting context]. [Specific numbers].
```

✅ **Entity optimization:**
- Define terms clearly before using them
- Link to Wikipedia/authoritative entities
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add structured data (Organization, Person, Product)

✅ **Freshness signals:**
- Update cornerstone content every 60-90 days (content <90 days old receives 2.7x higher citation rates)
- Add "Last updated: [date]" visibly
- Reference current year in content
- Update statistics and data points

### GEO Content Formula

**Citable content pattern:**
```
[Definitive statement]. [Specific data point]. [Source attribution].
```

**Example:**
> "The average enterprise SaaS contract is worth $118,000 annually. According to KeyBanc's 2025 SaaS Survey, this represents a 23% increase from 2024."

### AI Overview Citation Triggers

| Content Type | Citation Likelihood | Why |
|--------------|--------------------|----|
| **Original research/data** | Very High | Unique, authoritative, verifiable |
| **Step-by-step guides** | High | Actionable, structured, complete |
| **Definitions/explanations** | High | Clear, quotable, educational |
| **Listicles/comparisons** | High (25% of citations) | Structured, scannable, decision-useful |
| **Comparisons with specifics** | Medium-High | Decision-useful, balanced |
| **Opinion/commentary** | Low | Not authoritative enough |
| **Thin aggregation** | Very Low | No unique value |

### Platform-Specific Optimization (January 2026)

| Platform | Market Share | Optimization Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | 90%+ of AI search | Critical |
| **ChatGPT Browse/Search** | Growing | High |
| **Perplexity** | ~5M daily users | Medium-High |
| **Bing Copilot** | Limited | Medium |
| **Claude** | Research use | Low-Medium |

**Platform Citation Patterns (2026 Benchmarks)**

Each AI platform has distinct citation preferences. Only 11% of domains are cited by both ChatGPT and Perplexity—platform-specific strategies are essential.

| Platform | Top Citation Source | % of Citations | Optimization Focus |
|----------|--------------------|--------------:|-------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Wikipedia, encyclopedic content | 47.9% | Authoritative, comprehensive definitions |
| **Perplexity** | Reddit, forums | 46.7% | Community validation, real user experiences |
| **Google AI Overviews** | YouTube, multimodal | 23.3% | Video content, visual explanations |

### What NOT to Do (GEO Anti-Patterns)

| ❌ Mistake | Why It Fails | ✅ Instead |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Create "AI-optimized" pages | Weakens intent match | Optimize existing high-value pages |
| Stuff content with questions | Feels spammy, ignores intent | Use questions that match real queries |
| Block AI crawlers entirely | Reduces visibility everywhere | Use selective controls, monitor impact |
| Ignore traditional SEO | 76% of citations come from top 10 | GEO is additive, not replacement |
| Chase every AI platform | Spreads effort too thin | Focus on Google AI Overviews first |

---

## Core: SERP Surface Evolution (January 2026)

Search results are no longer 10 blue links. Modern SERP surfaces:

| SERP Feature | Visibility Impact | Optimization Priority |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Rich Results** (eligible types only) | High — enhanced display | Implement only where supported |
| **Answer Boxes** | Very high — position zero | Concise, direct answers |
| **Knowledge Panels** | High for entities | Entity/brand optimization |
| **People Also Ask** | Medium-high | Question-answer format |
| **Local Pack** (if relevant) | High | Strong location signals + GBP |
| **Video / Image Surfaces** | Medium-high | Media SEO + clear metadata |
| **Zero-Click / On-SERP Answers** | High | Optimize for visibility + intent |

### Zero-Click Reality

More queries are satisfied on the results page via answer boxes, panels, and rich results. Plan for it:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Accept** | Optimize for brand visibility in zero-click (answer boxes, panels) |
| **Adapt** | Target queries with click-through intent (commercial/transactional) |
| **Measure** | Track impressions AND clicks, not just rankings |

### Do
- Use structured data only where eligible and accurate; do not assume visibility (FAQ rich results eligibility is limited; HowTo rich results are deprecated: https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/08/howto-faq-changes and https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage)
- Structure content for featured snippet extraction (question → direct answer → details)
- Monitor SERP features for your target keywords

### Avoid
- Measuring SEO success by rankings alone (impressions matter)
- Ignoring zero-click—it's visibility even without traffic
- Over-optimizing for features your content can't win

---

## Core: Brand Visibility & Trust Signals

### E-E-A-T Framework (Google Quality Raters)

| Signal | What It Means | How to Demonstrate |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Experience** | First-hand knowledge | Case studies, original data, personal narrative |
| **Expertise** | Subject matter depth | Author credentials, technical accuracy |
| **Authoritativeness** | Industry recognition | Backlinks, citations, press mentions |
| **Trust** | Reliability, safety | HTTPS, clear contact, accurate info, reviews |

Source: Google Search Quality Rater Guidelines (used for human evaluation, not a direct ranking checklist): https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf

### Do
- Add author bios with credentials to expertise content
- Include original research, data, or unique insights
- Get cited by authoritative sources in your niche
- Keep information accurate and updated

### Avoid
- Anonymous "admin" authored content for YMYL topics
- Rehashing competitor content without adding value
- Neglecting site security and trust signals

---

## Core: Content Discoverability Checklist

Use before publishing any content:

| Check | Requirement | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Intent mapped | Clear primary intent identified (one page = one intent) | |
| H1 + meta title | Include target query, <60 chars | |
| Meta description | Clear value prop, <155 chars | |
| URL structure | 5-7 words, semantic, no parameters | |
| Internal links | 3+ contextual links to/from related pages | |
| Structured data | Implement only eligible, accurate types | |
| First paragraph | Direct answer to query in first 100 words | |
| Freshness signal | Date published/updated visible | |
| Mobile usability | Mobile-first layout and QA (see Google guidance on Page Experience and retired Mobile Usability report: https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/04/page-experience-in-search) | |
| Performance | Core Web Vitals monitored (LCP/INP/CLS: https://web.dev/articles/vitals) | |

### Heading Structure Requirements

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| H1 | 1 per page, contains primary keyword |
| H2 | 2–5 per page, covers subtopics |
| H3 | Only if nested under H2 |

**Anti-patterns:** Multiple H1s, random heading order, skipping levels (H1 → H3)

### E-E-A-T Requirements (Critical for YMYL Topics)

For content in health, finance, legal, or sensitive topics:

**Required trust pages:**
- About page (with credentials)
- Methodology page (how data/predictions are calculated)
- Disclaimer page
- Contact page (real phone/email)
- Privacy Policy + Terms of Service

**Without E-E-A-T signals → Pages drop from index (especially YMYL).**

## Core: Measurement Framework

### What to Track

Track visibility, engagement, and business outcomes together (Search Console metric definitions: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7576553?hl=en).

| Metric | Where | Use It For |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Impressions** | Google Search Console | Demand/visibility trends by query/page |
| **Clicks** | Google Search Console | Traffic contribution by query/page |
| **CTR** | Google Search Console | Snippet/title alignment to intent |
| **Average position** | Google Search Console | Directional ranking movement (not a KPI alone) |
| **Landing conversions** | Analytics/CRM | Query/page → lead/signup/purchase rate |
| **Assisted conversions** | Analytics | Content influence across longer journeys |
| **Brand demand** | Search Console + Trends | Branded query growth and protection |

### What to Ignore (Vanity)

- Rankings without traffic context
- Impressions without CTR analysis
- Backlink counts without quality assessment and relevance
- Page-level metrics without conversion attribution

---

Use this skill when the user asks for:
- Search intent and content mapping
- SERP feature targeting and snippet optimization
- Content discoverability audits (technical + editorial)
- Brand visibility and trust signal improvements (E-E-A-T)
- Measurement plans (impressions, clicks, CTR, assisted conversions)
- Optional: visibility in AI answer engines and assistant surfaces

---

## Decision Trees (Quick Use)

```text
### High impressions, low clicks (GSC)
Intent mismatch → Narrow query target or split page by intent
Snippet mismatch → Rewrite title/snippet to match query language and value
SERP feature loss → Add eligible structured data; improve media; strengthen internal links

### Traffic ok, conversions low
Wrong offer for intent → Add comparison/pricing/use-case path for commercial intent
Friction high → Reduce form fields, speed up page, improve trust signals
Weak proof → Add quantified outcomes, case studies, security/compliance

### Page not indexed / not visible
Blocked → robots.txt / meta robots / auth / soft-404
Duplicate → canonical + internal linking + sitemap hygiene
JS render issues → SSR/SSG for primary content (dynamic rendering is deprecated: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/dynamic-rendering)

### Optional: AI answer engines not mentioning brand
[Inference] Audience uses assistants → Run AI visibility checks + fix discoverability
[Inference] Brand missing → Publish canonical, citable pages; strengthen entity signals
```

For optional AI/assistant decision trees, see the "Optional: AI / Automation" section.

### Key Differentiators

[Inference] This skill treats modern search as a system: crawl/index/render + intent + SERP surfaces + measurement. Optional AI/assistant optimization is additive, not a replacement.

---

## External Resources

See [data/sources.json](data/sources.json) for 28 primary documentation sources across:
- Google Search docs (fundamentals, crawling/indexing, appearance)
- web.dev guidance (Core Web Vitals and performance)
- Search Console measurement definitions
- Optional assistant visibility controls (Google-Extended, GPTBot) (tagged optional)

---

## Getting Started

**First-time setup (30–60 minutes):**
1. Run [assets/audits/search-visibility-audit.md](assets/audits/search-visibility-audit.md) on the top 10–20 pages.
2. Fix obvious indexability issues (robots/noindex/canonicals/sitemaps) using [../marketing-seo-complete/SKILL.md](../marketing-seo-complete/SKILL.md).
3. Pick 5–10 queries per ICP segment; map each to a single intent and page.
4. Add measurement: GSC dashboards + conversion events (define what "conversion" means).

**Weekly cadence (60 minutes/week):**
1. Review GSC: high impressions + low CTR queries; ship 5 title/snippet improvements.
2. Review conversions by landing page; fix the 1–2 worst offenders with the CRO checklist.
3. Ship 1 new commercial-intent page or update 1 core page for freshness and proof.

---

## Optional: AI / Automation

> **Note**: Use this only if your ICP actually discovers products via assistants/answer engines. Keep SEO fundamentals as the baseline.

### What to Do First (AI Visibility)

1. Run `assets/audits/ai-search-content-audit.md` on 5–10 key pages.
2. Validate that key pages are indexable and canonical (assistants often cite canonical URLs first).
3. Ensure content has citation-grade proof: original data, reproducible steps, and clear definitions.

### Crawler Controls (AI Training vs Search)

- Google-Extended is a standalone product token that publishers can use to control whether their content is used for certain AI features; it does not impact inclusion in Google Search (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/google-common-crawlers#google-extended).
- [Inference] For other providers, follow their official crawler documentation for allow/deny and rate limits; do not guess user-agent strings.

### Do (AI Visibility)

- Prioritize pages that already drive conversions (not net-new content for an unproven channel).
- Make claims auditable: add sources, screenshots, definitions, and dates.
- Keep a single canonical URL per topic; avoid duplicate thin variants.

### Avoid (AI Visibility)

- Treating assistant visibility as a replacement for SEO or product positioning.
- Publishing "AI-first" pages that weaken intent match and conversion clarity.
- Over-investing in tools before you can observe any incremental pipeline impact.

---

## Collaboration Notes

### With Product

**Core**
- Positioning and messaging should inform target queries and page hierarchy.
- Feature pages need clear claims, proof, and intent-aligned CTAs.
- Docs and changelogs should be indexable, canonical, and internally linked.

**Optional: AI / Automation**
- [Inference] Technical docs are frequently reused in assistant answers; keep them current and link to canonical sources.

### With Sales

**Core**
- Mine objections and FAQs to create commercial-intent pages (comparisons, security, integrations, pricing).
- Align on "good lead" definition so content targets the right intent.

**Optional: AI / Automation**
- [Inference] Monitor brand/competitor questions in assistants to find missing pages and trust gaps.

### With Engineering

**Core**
- Implement and version control: `robots.txt`, canonicals, redirects, sitemaps, and structured data.
- Maintain performance budgets and monitor Core Web Vitals (https://web.dev/articles/vitals).
- Ensure analytics events and UTMs survive navigation and cross-domain flows.

**Optional: AI / Automation**
- Coordinate any AI training controls (for example Google-Extended: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/google-common-crawlers#google-extended).

## 2026 Ranking Factors for AI Search Visibility

**Sources**: [Backlinko Ranking Study](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors), [Search Engine Land AI SEO](https://searchengineland.com/), [Princeton GEO Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735)

### AI Citation Ranking Factors

AI systems (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity) pull citations differently than traditional search. Key factors:

| Factor | Weight | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Topical authority** | Critical | AI systems prefer sources that cover topics comprehensively |
| **Content freshness** | High | AI Overviews favor updated content; 3-month recency ideal |
| **Quotability** | High | Concise, definitive statements get cited more often |
| **Original data/research** | High | Unique statistics, studies, surveys are citation magnets |
| **E-E-A-T signals** | High | Author credentials, methodology pages, clear sourcing |
| **Traditional rankings** | High | 76% of AI Overview citations come from top 10 results |
| **Structured data** | Medium | Helps AI understand entities, relationships, facts |
| **Site speed** | Medium | Fast sites get crawled more, indexed fresher |

### Content Attributes That Get Cited

| Attribute | Citation Rate | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Specific numbers** | Very High | "72% of users prefer..." vs "most users prefer..." |
| **Step-by-step processes** | High | Numbered, actionable instructions |
| **Definitions** | High | "X is defined as..." or "[Term] refers to..." |
| **Comparisons** | Medium-High | "X vs Y: [specific differences]" |
| **Expert quotes** | Medium | Named sources with credentials |
| **General opinions** | Low | Vague statements without backing |

### Algorithm Update Impact (December 2025)

| Update | Impact on AI Visibility |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Helpful Content integration** | Low-value AI content filtered aggressively |
| **E-E-A-T elevation** | Experience signals now required, not optional |
| **Brand authority boost** | Known brands appear more in AI Overviews |
| **Freshness weighting** | Stale content drops faster in AI citations |

### GEO Ranking Checklist

**Technical foundation (same as traditional SEO):**
- [ ] Core Web Vitals passing (LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1)
- [ ] Mobile-first optimized
- [ ] Fast TTFB (<600ms)
- [ ] Clean crawlability (no blocks, proper canonicals)

**AI citation optimization:**
- [ ] First paragraph contains quotable, definitive answer
- [ ] Specific numbers, dates, statistics included
- [ ] Claims attributed to sources
- [ ] Author bio with credentials (for YMYL)
- [ ] "Last updated" date visible and accurate
- [ ] Structured data for key entities

**Content structure:**
- [ ] One clear intent per page
- [ ] Question-based H2s matching real queries
- [ ] Direct answers before elaboration
- [ ] Original data or unique insights

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Core

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Reporting rankings only | Hides the real outcome | Report impressions, clicks, CTR, and conversions (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7576553?hl=en) |
| Publishing without intent mapping | Pages miss the query and the CTA | One page, one primary intent, one primary conversion |
| Gating early-stage pages | Kills discovery and trust | Gate only high-intent or high-value assets |
| Schema spam | Manual actions risk; no upside | Implement accurate, eligible structured data only |
| Many thin near-duplicates | Cannibalization and index bloat | Consolidate to canonical pages + strong internal links |

### Optional: AI / Automation

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Publishing "AI-first" pages | Weakens intent match and conversion clarity | Treat assistant visibility as additive to SEO |
| Blocking all crawlers "for protection" | Can reduce visibility in multiple systems | Use explicit controls and rate limiting where needed |
| Chasing every assistant platform | Spreads effort too thin | Validate one channel with measurable pipeline impact first |

## Complete AI Indexing Guide (January 2026)

For the full DO & DON'T guide with implementation priorities, see:
→ **[ai-indexing-complete-guide.md](references/ai-indexing-complete-guide.md)**

### Quick Reference

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Traffic shift to AI | 25% by 2026 | Gartner |
| Visibility boost from GEO | +40% | Princeton study |
| Citations from top 10 | 76% | Traditional SEO still critical |

**Top 3 Actions**:
1. Allow AI crawlers in robots.txt (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot)
2. Add statistics to top pages (+35-40% visibility)
3. Update content every 60-90 days (freshness signal)

**December 2025 Change**: ChatGPT-User no longer respects robots.txt—block at firewall if needed.
