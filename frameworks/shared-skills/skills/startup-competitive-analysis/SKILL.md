# Startup Competitive Analysis

Systematic framework for understanding competitive landscapes, identifying positioning opportunities, and building sustainable competitive advantages.

**Modern Best Practices (Dec 2025)**:
- Define the competitive set broadly: direct, indirect, alternatives, and non-consumption.
- Prefer narrative + decision: “match vs ignore vs bet” over feature spreadsheets.
- Use claims + proof + landmines (objection handling) and keep sources date-stamped.
- Tie insights to experiments (positioning tests, pricing tests, win/loss loop).

## Positioning Framework (April Dunford)

### 5 Components of Positioning

```
1. COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES
   └─► What would customers do if you didn't exist?

2. UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES
   └─► What do you have that alternatives lack?

3. VALUE (and proof)
   └─► What value do those attributes enable?

4. TARGET CUSTOMER
   └─► Who cares a lot about that value?

5. MARKET CATEGORY
   └─► What context makes your value obvious?
```

### Positioning Canvas

| Component | Current State | Ideal State | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| Competitive Alternatives | | | |
| Unique Attributes | | | |
| Value Delivered | | | |
| Target Customer | | | |
| Market Category | | | |

### Positioning Statement Template

```
For [TARGET CUSTOMER]
who [SITUATION/NEED],
[PRODUCT] is a [MARKET CATEGORY]
that [KEY BENEFIT].
Unlike [COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE],
[PRODUCT] [KEY DIFFERENTIATOR].
```

## Weakness Mining (from Reviews)

### Pain Dimension Analysis

Connect to `startup-review-mining` for systematic extraction:

| Pain Dimension | What to Find | Opportunity |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **UI/UX** | "confusing", "hard to use" | Better experience |
| **Pricing** | "expensive", "hidden fees" | Better value/transparency |
| **Support** | "slow response", "unhelpful" | Better service |
| **Integration** | "can't connect", "API broken" | Better ecosystem |
| **Performance** | "slow", "crashes" | Better reliability |
| **Onboarding** | "steep learning curve" | Better activation |
| **Features** | "wish it had", "missing" | Feature gaps |

### Competitor Weakness Matrix

| Competitor | Top Weakness | Evidence | Our Opportunity |
|------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| {{COMP_A}} | {{WEAKNESS}} | {{QUOTE}} | {{OPPORTUNITY}} |
| {{COMP_B}} | {{WEAKNESS}} | {{QUOTE}} | {{OPPORTUNITY}} |
| {{COMP_C}} | {{WEAKNESS}} | {{QUOTE}} | {{OPPORTUNITY}} |

### Universal Weaknesses (All Competitors)

If all competitors share a weakness = major opportunity:

## Do / Avoid (Dec 2025)

### Do

- Segment competitors by “why customers choose them” (jobs, switching costs, distribution).
- Keep a living battlecard with dated proof points (links, quotes, win/loss notes).
- Make explicit parity decisions (match/ignore/bet) with rationale and owners.

### Avoid

- Feature grids without buying criteria and narrative.
- Claiming superiority without evidence.
- Copying competitors instead of strengthening a wedge.

## What Good Looks Like

- Competitive set: direct, indirect, alternatives, and non-consumption explicitly mapped.
- Differentiation: clear wedge with “match/ignore/bet” decisions and owners.
- Battlecards: dated claims with proof (links, screenshots, quotes) and objection handling.
- Insights → action: competitive learnings translate into roadmap bets or sales talk tracks.
- Cadence: quarterly refresh or after major competitor releases (win/loss loop included).

## Optional: AI / Automation

Use only when explicitly requested and policy-compliant.

- Summarize public docs/reviews into claims; keep links and spot-check.
- Cluster win/loss notes into objections and landmines; validate with calls.
