# Git Workflow (Modern Team Collaboration)

Use modern Git collaboration patterns: GitHub Flow for continuous deploy, trunk-based for scale, Conventional Commits for automation, stacked diffs for large features.

Use this skill to choose a branching model, standardize PR discipline, enforce commit conventions, and harden repository settings for safe collaboration.

## Quick Start

1. Identify constraints (team size, release cadence, CI maturity, compliance).
2. Choose a branching strategy using the decision tree.
3. Apply the baseline repo settings (branch protection, approvals, checks, merge strategy).
4. Use the relevant reference doc for implementation details.
5. If asked "best practice in 2026", verify via web search using `data/sources.json` as a starting source list.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Branching Strategy

```text
Use this decision tree to select the optimal branching strategy for your team based on team size, release cadence, and CI/CD maturity.

Team characteristics -> What's your situation?
    ├─ Small team (1-5 devs) + Continuous deployment + High CI/CD maturity?
    │   └─ GitHub Flow (main + feature branches)
    │
    ├─ Medium team (5-15 devs) + Continuous deployment + High CI/CD maturity?
    │   └─ Trunk-Based Development (main + short-lived branches)
    │
    ├─ Large team (15+ devs) + Continuous deployment + Very high CI/CD maturity?
    │   └─ Trunk-Based + Feature Flags (progressive rollout)
    │
    ├─ Scheduled releases + Medium CI/CD maturity?
    │   └─ GitFlow (main + develop + release branches)
    │
    └─ Multiple versions + Low-Medium CI/CD maturity?
        └─ GitFlow (long-lived release branches)
```

- Interactive rebase commands: pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, drop
- Splitting commits: Break large commits into focused changes
- Reordering commits: Logical commit history
- Best practices: Never rebase public branches

### Conflict Resolution

- Resolution strategies: `--ours`, `--theirs`, manual merge
- Rebase vs merge: When to use each
- Merge tool setup: VS Code, Meld, custom tools

## Navigation: Learning & Troubleshooting

### Common Mistakes

**[Common Mistakes & Fixes](references/common-mistakes.md)** - Learn from common pitfalls

- Large unfocused PRs -> Split into stacked diffs
- Vague commit messages -> Use conventional commits
- Rewriting public history -> Never rebase main
- Ignoring review comments -> Address all feedback
- Committing secrets -> Use environment variables
- Force push dangers -> Use `--force-with-lease`

## Decision Tables

### When to Use Each Branching Strategy

| Requirement | GitHub Flow | Trunk-Based | GitFlow |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Continuous deployment | [OK] Best | [OK] Best | [FAIL] Poor |
| Scheduled releases | [WARNING] OK | [WARNING] OK | [OK] Best |
| Multiple versions | [FAIL] Poor | [FAIL] Poor | [OK] Best |
| Small team (< 5) | [OK] Best | [WARNING] OK | [FAIL] Overkill |
| Large team (> 15) | [WARNING] OK | [OK] Best | [WARNING] OK |
| Fast iteration | [OK] Best | [OK] Best | [FAIL] Poor |

### PR Size vs Review Time

| LOC | Review Time | Bug Detection | Recommendation |
|-----|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| < 50 | < 10 min | High | [OK] Ideal for hotfixes |
| 50-200 | 10-30 min | High | [OK] Ideal for features |
| 200-400 | 30-60 min | Medium-High | [OK] Acceptable |
| 400-1000 | 1-2 hours | Medium | [WARNING] Consider splitting |
| > 1000 | > 2 hours | Low | [FAIL] Always split |

## Do / Avoid

### GOOD: Do

- Keep PRs under 400 lines (200-400 optimal)
- Use conventional commit messages
- Rebase before opening PR (clean history)
- Require at least one approval before merge
- Run CI checks on every PR
- Use stacked diffs for large features (>500 LOC)
- Squash WIP commits before merge
- Use `--force-with-lease` (not `--force`)

### BAD: Avoid

- Long-lived feature branches (>3 days)
- Merging without review
- Rebasing public/shared branches
- Force pushing to main/master
- Committing secrets (even "temporarily")
- Large monolithic PRs (>1000 lines)
- Vague commit messages ("fix", "update")
- Skipping CI to merge faster

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Long-lived branches** | Merge conflicts, stale code | Trunk-based, short branches |
| **Unreviewed merges** | Bugs reach production | Branch protection rules |
| **Rebasing main** | History corruption | Never rebase public branches |
| **1000+ LOC PRs** | Poor review quality | Stacked diffs, split PRs |
| **"fix" commits** | Unclear history | Conventional commits |
| **No CI gates** | Broken main | Required status checks |
| **Secrets in history** | Security breach | Pre-commit hooks, gitleaks |

## Repository Baseline (Security + Reliability)

Set these repo defaults before scaling a team:

- **Branch protection**: require PRs to `main` (no direct pushes), require status checks, require up-to-date branch on merge.
- **Review gates**: require approvals; enforce CODEOWNERS for sensitive paths (auth, payments, infra, prod configs).
- **History policy**: pick merge strategy (squash vs merge commits) and make it consistent; document exceptions.
- **Signed changes**: require signed commits and signed tags for releases (team-specific key management).
- **Secret prevention**: local pre-commit + server-side secret scanning/push protection; rotate on incident.
- **Merge safety**: use merge queue (or equivalent) for busy repos to keep `main` green under high concurrency.
- **Cost control**: cache dependencies/builds; run heavy jobs conditionally; cap CI minutes for untrusted forks.

## Security-Sensitive Changes

For security-related git operations, see [git-commit-message/assets/template-security-commits.md](../git-commit-message/assets/template-security-commits.md):

- Secrets detection with pre-commit hooks
- Handling accidental secret commits
- Security commit metadata (CVE, CVSS)
- Branch protection for security-sensitive code

## Optional: AI/Automation

> **Note**: AI tools assist but cannot replace human judgment for merge decisions.

- **PR summarization** - Generate description from commits
- **Change risk labeling** - Flag high-risk files (auth, payments)
- **Review suggestions** - Identify potential reviewers

### Bounded Claims

- AI summaries need human verification
- Risk labels are suggestions, not guarantees
- Merge decisions always require human approval

- Reference assets/ for copy-paste ready configurations
- Use references/ for deep-dive implementation guidance

**Progressive Disclosure**:

1. Start with Quick Reference for fast lookups
2. Use Decision Tree for choosing strategies
3. Navigate to specific resources for detailed implementation
4. Reference templates for production-ready configurations
5. Check validation checklists before PR/merge/release

## Quick Command Reference

**Common Operations**:

```bash
# Rebase feature branch
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main

# Interactive rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Squash all commits in branch
git rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD main)

# Force push safely
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick abc123

# Stash changes
git stash push -m "WIP: implementing feature X"
git stash pop
```

**Conflict Resolution**:

```bash
# Pull latest with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main

# Use visual merge tool
git mergetool

# Accept their changes
git checkout --theirs <file>

# Accept your changes
git checkout --ours <file>
```
