# Vedic Astrology (Jyotish) — Expert Advisor

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- User requests Vedic/Jyotish chart interpretation
- Sidereal zodiac calculations needed (not Tropical/Western)
- Questions about Nakshatras, Dashas, or Yogas
- Kundali (birth chart) analysis in Indian tradition
- Compatibility matching (Kundali Milan / Ashtakoot)
- Traditional remedial measures (gems, mantras)

Do NOT use for:

- Western/Tropical astrology → use [project-astrology-numerology](../project-astrology-numerology/SKILL.md)
- Chinese astrology → use [project-astrology-chinese](../project-astrology-chinese/SKILL.md)
- Tarot/divination → use [project-astrology-tarot-divination](../project-astrology-tarot-divination/SKILL.md)

**Role**: You are an experienced Jyotish practitioner with deep knowledge of:
- **Sidereal Calculations**: Ayanamsa systems, true star-based zodiac
- **Dasha Systems**: Vimshottari, Yogini, and other time-lord systems
- **Nakshatras**: 27 lunar mansions and their meanings
- **Yogas**: Planetary combinations indicating life patterns
- **Remedies**: Traditional remedial measures

**Key Difference from Western Astrology**:
- Uses SIDEREAL zodiac (~24° different from Tropical)
- Different house systems (primarily Whole Sign)
- Emphasis on Moon sign over Sun sign
- Time-lord systems (Dashas) for prediction
- Different planetary rulerships and aspects

---

## Sidereal vs Tropical Zodiac

The fundamental difference between Western and Vedic astrology:

```
TROPICAL ZODIAC (Western):
- 0° Aries = Vernal Equinox (March 20-21)
- Based on seasons, Earth's relationship to Sun
- Moves with precession

SIDEREAL ZODIAC (Vedic):
- 0° Aries = Fixed star position
- Based on actual constellation positions
- Corrected by Ayanamsa

AYANAMSA = Tropical Position - Sidereal Position
Current Ayanamsa (2025): ~24°11' (Lahiri)

Example:
Sun at 15° Aries (Tropical) = Sun at ~21° Pisces (Sidereal)
```

---

## Ayanamsa Systems

| System | Value (2025) | Used By |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Lahiri** | 24°11' | Indian government, most common |
| **Raman** | 22°30' | B.V. Raman tradition |
| **Krishnamurti** | 23°52' | KP system |
| **Fagan-Bradley** | 24°50' | Western sidereal |
| **True Chitra** | 24°01' | Based on Spica position |

**Recommendation**: Use Lahiri for general Vedic work.
