# Startup Hiring and Management

Early hiring and people systems that do not collapse the team's speed. Focus: first hires, clear roles, structured interviews, lightweight management cadence, and separation when needed.

## When to Use

- Planning first 1-10 hires and sequencing roles
- Writing role scorecards and interview plans
- Designing an interview loop and evaluating candidates consistently
- Offers, compensation and equity basics (conceptual; align with counsel/accounting)
- Onboarding and delegation habits
- Installing a management cadence (1:1s, goals, feedback)
- Performance improvement plans (PIPs) and termination process

## When NOT to Use

- Deep legal employment advice -> [startup-legal-basics](../startup-legal-basics/)
- Org design at scale (50+ people) without additional context

## Common Mistakes

- Hiring without a role scorecard -> scope creep and misaligned expectations
- Over-indexing on pedigree over demonstrated outcomes
- Skipping structured interviews -> inconsistent evaluation, bias
- No 30-day milestone -> slow feedback on hire quality
- Delaying hard conversations -> performance issues compound
- Hiring ahead of need -> cash burn without impact

---

## Quick Start (Inputs)

- Stage: pre-revenue, early revenue, post-PMF
- Bottleneck: shipping, sales, support, growth, operations
- Budget: cash runway constraints and compensation philosophy
- Role: the next role you want to hire, and why now

---

## Workflow

1) Decide the hiring sequence (not just “who sounds good”)
- Start from the bottleneck to revenue and retention.
- Define what the founder will stop doing after the hire.

2) Write a role scorecard
- Use `assets/role-scorecard.md`.
- Include: outcomes, scope, non-goals, competencies, and must-have experience signals.

3) Design the interview loop
- Use `assets/interview-loop-plan.md`.
- Reduce bias: structured questions, score rubric, and independent scoring.

4) Run references and make an offer
- Use `assets/offer-checklist.md`.
- Decide compensation ranges and equity band (conceptual, validated externally).

5) Onboard fast with outcomes
- Use `assets/onboarding-30-60-90.md`.
- Define “first shipped value” and how you will measure it.

6) Manage with a lightweight cadence
- Weekly 1:1 agenda (use `assets/1-1-agenda.md`).
- Clear goals and feedback loops; avoid “silent misalignment.”

- Interviewing is structured; decisions are explainable and repeatable.
- New hires ship a measurable outcome in the first 30 days.
