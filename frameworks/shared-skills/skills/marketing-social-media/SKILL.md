# Social Media Marketing (Operational Skill)

This skill contains **actionable, non-theoretical operational systems** for sustainable social media marketing across LinkedIn, TikTok, Meta (FB/IG), YouTube, and X.

**Structure**: Core social media principles first. AI-specific automation in clearly labeled "Optional: AI / Automation" sections.

**Scope note**: For email outreach and lead generation, see [marketing-leads-generation](../marketing-leads-generation/SKILL.md). For SEO, see [marketing-seo-complete](../marketing-seo-complete/SKILL.md).

## How to use this skill

- Default workflow: pick goal -> pick 1-2 platforms -> set a sustainable cadence -> publish -> engage daily -> review weekly -> iterate monthly.
- Use `assets/` for ready-to-run templates; use `references/` for deep dives (platform, paid, community, AI governance).
- For time-sensitive platform changes, use the Trend Awareness Protocol.

## Core: Platform-Agnostic Principles

These principles apply regardless of platform. Master them before platform-specific tactics.

### The 3 Pillars

| Pillar | Description | Measure |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Audience** | Who you serve, their problems, what they value | Follower quality, engagement rate |
| **Format** | Content type optimized for platform + audience | View-through, completion, saves |
| **Cadence** | Consistent publishing rhythm | Posting frequency, time-to-response |

### Audience-First Thinking

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Who specifically am I creating for? | Generic content = generic results |
| What problem does this solve for them? | Value-first, not self-promotion |
| Where do they spend time online? | Platform selection follows audience |
| What format do they prefer? | Match format to consumption habits |

### Format Selection by Goal

| Goal | Best Formats | Worst Formats |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | Short-form video, carousels, threads | Long-form without distribution |
| **Engagement** | Polls, questions, controversial takes | Corporate announcements |
| **Authority** | Long-form, original research, case studies | Repurposed generic content |
| **Conversion** | Direct CTAs, testimonials, demos | Soft branding |

### Cadence Guidelines

Start with a cadence you can sustain for 8-12 weeks without sacrificing quality.

| Cadence Tier | Typical Output | Best For | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| **Light** | 2-3 posts/week | Small teams, early consistency | Use templates + repurposing |
| **Standard** | 4-7 posts/week | Most product teams | Mix educational + proof + community |
| **Heavy** | Daily + community touchpoints | Media-led teams | Requires strong production pipeline |

## Core: Content Typology

Every post should map to one of these types. Mix types across your content calendar.

| Type | Purpose | Example | Frequency |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Educational** | Teach something valuable | How-to, tutorial, framework | 40-50% |
| **Narrative** | Share stories that resonate | Personal journey, case study, behind-the-scenes | 20-30% |
| **Proof** | Demonstrate results/credibility | Testimonial, metric, achievement | 15-20% |
| **Community** | Engage and connect | Question, poll, reply, shoutout | 10-15% |
| **Promotional** | Drive action | Offer, CTA, launch | 5-10% max |

### Do (Content Mix)

- Plan content mix monthly, not post-by-post
- Lead with educational; end week with proof or community
- Test different type ratios for your audience
- Repurpose across types (educational -> narrative)

### Avoid (Content Mix)

- Mostly promotional content (looks like spam)
- All educational (no personality, no engagement)
- Random posting without type intention
- Copying competitor content 1:1

## Core: Engagement Quality vs Vanity Metrics

### What to Track (Quality)

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Saves/bookmarks** | Strong signal that content is useful |
| **Shares/reposts** | Indicates distribution value and message resonance |
| **Comment quality** | Depth of discussion and objections surfaced |
| **Profile visits** | Interest in the creator/company after content |
| **Link clicks** | Conversion path signal (only if UTMs are clean) |
| **Downstream conversions** | Sign-ups, demos, trials, purchases from social landings |

### What to Ignore (Vanity)

| Metric | Why It's Misleading |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Follower count alone** | Bots, inactive, wrong audience |
| **Impressions without engagement** | Seen != valued |
| **Likes without context** | Easy to give, low signal |
| **Viral posts without conversion** | Fame != revenue |

### Do (Metrics)

- Track engagement rate, not raw likes
- Monitor save rate as quality signal
- Measure conversion from social (UTMs, ask "how did you hear about us")
- Compare metrics to your own baseline, not others

### Avoid (Metrics)

- Buying followers or engagement
- Chasing viral at expense of relevance
- Ignoring negative engagement signals (unfollows, hides)
- Reporting vanity metrics to stakeholders

## Core: Revenue Attribution & ROI

Transform social from cost center to revenue driver by measuring business impact.

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | See Reference |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Social-to-Revenue** | Social CAC, LTV:CAC, pipeline influence | [revenue-attribution-framework.md](references/revenue-attribution-framework.md) |
| **Influencer ROI** | CPA, ROAS, EMV, content asset value | [revenue-attribution-framework.md](references/revenue-attribution-framework.md) |
| **Community ROI** | Member LTV premium, support deflection, retention delta | [revenue-attribution-framework.md](references/revenue-attribution-framework.md) |
| **Brand Lift** | Unaided/aided awareness, consideration, preference | [revenue-attribution-framework.md](references/revenue-attribution-framework.md) |

### Quick Implementation

1. **UTM discipline**: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term` on all links
2. **CRM integration**: Pass UTM data on conversion, tag closed deals with source
3. **Cohort analysis**: Compare LTV by acquisition source
4. **Attribution model**: Choose first-touch (awareness) or position-based (balanced)

### Key Benchmarks

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Social LTV:CAC | >3:1 |
| Influencer ROAS | >2x (direct), >4x (with EMV) |
| Community member LTV | 1.2-2x non-member |
| Support deflection | 20-40% |

## Core: Social -> Site -> Conversion Flows

Social media is rarely the conversion point. Design the flow:

```text
Social Post -> Link/Bio -> Landing Page -> Conversion

OR

Social Post -> DM/Comment -> Conversation -> Conversion

OR

Social Post -> Lead Magnet -> Email Nurture -> Conversion
```

### Flow Design Checklist

| Step | Question | If No |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Post** | Does it provide standalone value? | Rewrite - no one clicks without value |
| **CTA** | Is there one clear next action? | Simplify to single CTA |
| **Link/Bio** | Does it match post promise? | Align messaging |
| **Landing** | Does it load fast, mobile-first? | Optimize (see [marketing-seo-complete](../marketing-seo-complete/SKILL.md)) |
| **Conversion** | Is friction minimized? | Reduce form fields, add trust signals |

Use [content-distribution-plan.md](assets/content-distribution-plan.md) to plan search + social distribution for each piece of content.

### Do (Conversion Flows)

- Test bio link vs in-post link
- Use UTM parameters to track social -> site
- Optimize landing page for mobile-first reading and fast load
- Retarget engaged users who didn't convert

### Avoid (Conversion Flows)

- Generic bio links that don't change
- No tracking on social traffic
- Desktop-first landing pages
- Sending cold traffic straight to purchase

## Core: Community Management Basics

### Response Time Standards

| Interaction Type | Target Response Time |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Comment on your post** | Same day (faster during launch windows) |
| **Direct message** | Within 1 business day (faster for high-intent inquiries) |
| **Mention/tag** | Within 24 hours |
| **Negative feedback** | ASAP (same day) |

### Moderation Principles

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Spam/bot** | Delete and block |
| **Constructive criticism** | Thank, address publicly |
| **Negative but valid** | Acknowledge, offer to continue privately |
| **Trolling/harassment** | Hide/delete, block if repeated |
| **Questions** | Answer helpfully, link to resources |

### Do (Community)

- Respond to every real comment (first week especially)
- Ask follow-up questions to drive discussion
- Highlight community members (reshare, mention)
- Set community guidelines for owned spaces

### Avoid (Community)

- Ignoring comments (signals you don't care)
- Deleting all criticism (looks like hiding)
- Generic copy-paste responses
- Letting trolls derail conversations

## Platform Fit Notes (2026)

| Platform | Best For | Primary Formats | Key notes |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **LinkedIn** | B2B, authority | Text posts, carousels, native video | Dwell time and meaningful comments matter; employee amplification can materially help |
| **X** | News, opinions, real-time | Short posts, threads, quotes | Fast half-life; write for context collapse (assume zero prior context) |
| **TikTok** | Discovery, social commerce | Vertical video, live, TikTok Shop | Retention is the core signal; test multiple lengths and hooks |
| **Instagram** | Visual storytelling, creators | Reels, carousels, stories | Reels/carousels drive reach; make the first 2 seconds and cover/frame clear |
| **YouTube** | Evergreen + search | Long-form + Shorts + Shopping | Retention + session time matter; titles/thumbnails are part of the product |
| **Reddit** | High-trust communities | Text posts, AMAs, participation | Authentic voice required; follow subreddit norms; avoid drive-by promotion |
| **Threads** | Conversation (Meta ecosystem) | Short posts, threads | Strong tie-in with IG; treat as community/engagement channel, not a link farm |
| **Pinterest** | Discovery, shopping intent | Pins, idea pins | Strong for evergreen product/content and visual search categories |

Organic: Inconsistent -> Set sustainable cadence | Low engagement -> Improve value density | Low clicks -> Strengthen CTA
Community: Spam rising -> Enforce guidelines | Low retention -> Add rituals | Negative sentiment -> Acknowledge publicly
```

## External Resources

See [data/sources.json](data/sources.json) for official documentation across Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, YouTube, and platform analytics (automation sources are tagged optional).

## Safety and compliance (required)

- Follow each platform's policies and ad standards; verify disclosure requirements for sponsored/branded content in your market.
- Do not recommend buying followers/engagement, deceptive tactics, or automation that impersonates humans.
- Avoid storing or sharing personal data; use aggregated metrics and consent-based tracking.

## Optional: AI / Automation

> **Note**: Core social media fundamentals above work without AI tools. This section covers optional automation capabilities.

### Scheduling & Publishing

| Tool | Platforms | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Buffer** | All major | Simple scheduling, analytics |
| **Hootsuite** | All major | Enterprise, team collaboration |
| **Later** | IG, TikTok, Pinterest | Visual planning, link-in-bio |
| **Sprout Social** | All major | Enterprise, CRM integration |
| **Native schedulers** | Platform-specific | Best reach (some algorithms favor native) |

### AI Content Assistance

| Use Case | Tools | Consideration |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Ideation** | ChatGPT, Claude | Starting point only - add human insight |
| **Hook generation** | LLM prompts | A/B test AI vs human hooks |
| **Repurposing** | Opus Clip, Descript | Video -> clips, long -> short |
| **Image generation** | Midjourney, DALL-E | Check platform policies on AI content |
| **Caption writing** | LLM prompts | Always edit for brand voice |

### Moderation & Monitoring

| Use Case | Tools | Benefit |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Comment moderation** | Meta AI, Sprinklr | Filter spam, flag issues |
| **Brand monitoring** | Mention, Brand24 | Track mentions across platforms |
| **Sentiment analysis** | Sprout, Brandwatch | Aggregate sentiment trends |

### Do (AI/Automation)

- Use scheduling to maintain consistency when you can't post live
- Test AI-generated hooks/captions against human-written
- Automate monitoring, not engagement (replies should be human)
- Label AI-generated content where required by platform

### Avoid (AI/Automation)

- Full automation of replies/DMs (obvious, damages trust)
- AI content without human review (brand voice, factual accuracy)
- Over-relying on AI ideation (becomes generic)
- Ignoring platform policies on AI content disclosure

See [references/ai-marketing-governance.md](references/ai-marketing-governance.md) for AI governance framework.

## Trend Awareness Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: When users ask time-sensitive recommendation questions about social media marketing, verify current platform changes before answering.

- If a WebSearch tool is available, use it.
- Prefer official docs and policy pages listed in [data/sources.json](data/sources.json), then validate with up-to-date reporting.
- If you cannot use WebSearch, state that you are using stable principles and propose an experiment plan to validate assumptions.

### Trigger Conditions

- "What's the best social media strategy for 2026?"
- "What should I focus on for [LinkedIn/TikTok/Instagram]?"
- "What's trending on [platform]?"
- "Current best practices for [Reels/Shorts/Stories]?"
- "Is [platform/format] still relevant in 2026?"
- "How has the [LinkedIn/TikTok/Instagram] algorithm changed?"
- "What content format works best on [platform]?"

### Required Searches

1. Search: `"social media marketing trends 2026"`
2. Search: `"[LinkedIn/TikTok/Instagram] algorithm 2026"`
3. Search: `"[platform] best practices January 2026"`
4. Search: `"social media engagement trends 2026"`

### What to Report

After searching, provide:

- **Current landscape**: What platforms/formats work NOW
- **Emerging trends**: New features or platforms gaining traction
- **Deprecated/declining**: Strategies or formats losing effectiveness
- **Recommendation**: Based on fresh data, not just static knowledge

### Example Topics (verify with fresh search)

- Platform algorithm changes (LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram, X)
- New content formats (Threads, Notes, Shorts features)
- Creator economy trends and monetization
- AI content creation tools for social
- Community features and engagement patterns
- Cross-platform posting best practices

## International Markets

This skill covers global platforms (Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok). For regional platforms:

| Need | See Skill |
|------|-----------|
| China platforms (WeChat, Douyin, Weibo, RED) | [marketing-geo-localization](../marketing-geo-localization/SKILL.md) |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Post and ghost** | No feedback loop; weak trust | Set a response SLA and seed discussion |
| **Same content everywhere** | Ignores platform culture | Adapt format and tone per platform |
| **Chasing followers** | Vanity metric, often wrong audience | Focus on engagement rate, conversions |
| **Inconsistent posting** | Breaks continuity and learnings | Batch content, reuse templates, schedule |
| **All promotional** | Audience tunes out | Make promotion the minority; lead with value |
| **Ignoring analytics** | Can't improve what you don't measure | Weekly metric review, monthly deep dive |
| **Copying competitors** | No differentiation, always behind | Study competitors, create unique angle |
| **Buying engagement** | Platform detection, fake audience | Build organic, slower but real |
| **No conversion path** | Social activity without business results | Clear CTA, tracked links, landing pages |
| **Platform dependency** | Distribution risk | Build owned channels (email, community) and retargeting |
