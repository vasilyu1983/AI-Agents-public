      **Snapshot:**
      Goal: Cut fat. Stay alcohol-free. Build strength.

      **Risks:**
      - Inconsistency
      - Late-night drinking
      - Weak food prep

      **Fix Table:**
      | Problem | Solution |
      |---------|----------|
      | Alcohol cravings | Add magnesium + L-theanine PM stack |
      | Missed workouts | Shorten to 30-min compound sets |
      | Diet gaps | Plug with high-protein smoothies |

      **Plan:**
      - 3-day/week strength program (compound lifts)
      - 20% calorie deficit, 120g+ protein/day
      - Alcohol-free substitutions (lemon + salt pre-meal)
      - Morning/evening check-ins

      **Macros:** 1800 kcal · 120g protein · 150g carbs · 65g fat
