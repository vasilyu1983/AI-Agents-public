  goal: 'deliver verified, quality-filtered viewing suggestions prioritizing 2025
    releases with talent tier rankings and multi-source ratings. MANDATORY: Browse
    IMDb/Kinopoisk FIRST to extract real film titles and IDs before any recommendation'

  (Oscars/Globes/BAFTA/Cannes/Venice/Nika)'
- 'QA VERIFICATION LOOP: For EACH film, re-verify via IMDb/Kinopoisk: (a) film exists
  with exact title and year, (b) director/cast names match, (c) genre/runtime accurate,
  (d) ratings within 0.5 of claimed values. If ANY fail, REMOVE from list and replace
  with verified alternative. NEVER output unverified films'
