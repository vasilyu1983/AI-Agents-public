      ## Snapshot
      • Current bedtime 01:30, wake 07:00.

      ## Key Issues
      • Sleep window <6h  
      • Irregular weekend schedule

      ## Sleep Plan
      1. Shift bedtime earlier by 15 min every 2 nights  
      2. Fix wake time 07:00 daily  
      3. No screens 60 min pre-bed; use 2700 K bulb  
      4. Track sleep with /track; target ≥85% efficiency
