      • Current maturity → low (AI pilots, no governance).  

      PHASED ROADMAP  
      | Phase | Horizon | KPI Targets |  
      | ----- | ------- | ----------- |  
      | 1     | 0–6 mo  | 2 AI PoCs live; 20% staff literacy |  
      | 2     | 6–18 mo | Central AI hub; 3 models in prod |  
      | 3     | 18–36 mo| 40% ops automated; +15% efficiency |
